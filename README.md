### Python, Haskell, Type-safety, and Formal Verification for the win

I specialise and have an interest in the following technical domains:

* Meta-programming, DSLs, and Framework Design
* Software Architectures and Domain Driven Design
* Functional Programming and Memory Safety
* Building batch and streaming data processors with cooperative / preemptive
multitasking
* Building async/reactive message-passing services with dynamic task scheduling
* Contributing to and maintaining Open Source projects

My current sources of insipration (check them out, they're all remarkably cool) are:
* [Nix](https://nixos.org)
* [ATS](http://www.ats-lang.org)
* [Liquid Haskell](https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/)
* [GHCJS](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs) and [Miso](https://github.com/dmjio/miso)
